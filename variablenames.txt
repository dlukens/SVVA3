Cell 1: Leading edge cell on the left
Cell 2: Trailing edge cell  on the right


Centroids
Cz in z direction
Cy in y direction

Moments of Inertia 

Izz over the z-axis
Iyy over the y-axis

Shear center
SCy line of symmetry which goes from the leading edge to the trailing edge 
SCz z-coordinate of the Shear Center

Enclosed Area
Am1= Enclosed Area of Cell 1
Am2= Enclosed Area of Cell 2

Amtotal= Am1 + Am2
